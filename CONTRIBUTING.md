# Contributing to the infrastructure template

If you are looking to contribute, get started by reading the following docs.

- Read about the [infrastructure's module architecture](/docs/infra/reference/module-architecture.md) to learn how the architecture of the infrastructure code is designed and how the modules interact with each other.
- Read the [template development workflow](/template-only-docs/template-development-workflow.md) to understand how to develop and test changes to the template because working on the platform templates is unlike working on most other applications.
- Read the [infrastructure style guide](/docs/infra/reference/style-guide.md) to understand best practices for Terraform and shell scripts.

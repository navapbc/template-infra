# Contributing to Nava Strata AWS Infrastructure Template

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nava Strata! Strata is a gold-standard target architecture and suite of open source tools that gives government agencies everything they need to run a modern service. We welcome contributions from developers, designers, policy experts, and community members. This document outlines how members of the community should approach the contribution process.

- Read about the [infrastructure's module architecture](/docs/infra/module-architecture.md) to learn how the architecture of the infrastructure code is designed and how the modules interact with each other.
- Read the [template development workflow](/template-only-docs/template-development-workflow.md) to understand how to develop and test changes to the template because working on the platform templates is unlike working on most other applications.
- Read the [infrastructure style guide](/docs/infra/style-guide.md) to understand best practices for Terraform and shell scripts.

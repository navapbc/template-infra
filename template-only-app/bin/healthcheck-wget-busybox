# --spider causes a HEAD request instead of GET, which while not that different
# and in most frameworks where you implement a GET handler it will automatically
# handle HEAD requests as well, some checkers (like AWS ALBs) specifically send
# GET requests, so we should match.
#
# So use --output-document instead, throwing away the response.

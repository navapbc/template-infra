# GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs vulnerability scans on the application's Docker image
# to ensure images built are secure before they are deployed.

# NOTE: The workflow isn't able to pass the docker image between jobs, so each builds the image.
#       A future PR will pass the image between the scans to reduce overhead and increase speed

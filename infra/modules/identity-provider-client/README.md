This collection of modules is used to create or access a Cognito identity provider.

- To create a new Cognito User Pool and App Client, use ./identity-provider and
  ./identity-provider-client.
- If instead of creating new resources, you want to connect to existing resources, use
  ./existing-identity-provider.

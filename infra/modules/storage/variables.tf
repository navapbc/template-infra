  Storage access should generally be controlled via attaching the `access_policy_arn`
  output to an IAM role, but there are some situations where that may not be possible.
  Generally when an AWS service doesn't have a way to assume a particular IAM role for operations.

  This list of AWS service principals (e.g., bedrock.amazonaws.com) will be used to configure 
  resources (e.g., the bucket's KMS key) such that the services will be able
  to access the bucket's objects.

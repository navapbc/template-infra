echo "Get workflow run id"
# The following commands aims to get the workflow run id of the run that was
# just triggered by the previous workflow dispatch event. There's currently no
# simple and reliable way to do this, so for now we are going to accept that
# there is a race condition.
#
# The current implementation involves getting the create time of the previous
# run. Then continuously checking the list of workflow runs until we see a
# newly created run. Then we get the id of this new run.

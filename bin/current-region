# The output format of `aws configure list` has changed over time, in particular
# the separator between config item name and value. We want to support both the
# older format:
#
#   region                us-west-2              env    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
#
# and the newer format:
#
#   region     : us-west-2                : env              : AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
#
# So tell Awk to use either whitespace OR `:` as the separator and grab the
# second field.
#
# Until such a time that `aws configure list` respects the `--output`/`--query`
# flag[1] and we can more robustly fetch just the value needed or we move away
# from calling it altogether.

# Notifications

The application may need to send email notifications to users. This document describes how to configure notifications. The notification setup process will:

1. Configure Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) for sending emails
2. Set up the necessary environment variables for the application service

## Requirements

Before setting up notifications you'll need to have [set up custom domains](/docs/infra/custom-domains.md) since notifications require a domain for the sender email address.

## 1. Enable notifications in application config

Update `enable_notifications = true` in your application's `app-config` module (`infra/<APP_NAME>/app-config/main.tf`).

## 2. Configure notification settings

The notification configuration is defined in the environment config module in `infra/<APP_NAME>/app-config/env-config/notifications.tf`. You can customize the following settings:

- `sender_display_name`: The name that appears in email clients (optional)
- `sender_email`: The email address used to send notifications (defaults to notifications@<domain_name>)
- `reply_to_email`: A different reply-to address if needed (defaults to sender_email)

## 3. Deploy the notification service

Run the following command:

```bash
make infra-update-app-service APP_NAME=<APP_NAME> ENVIRONMENT=<ENVIRONMENT>
```

## 4. Send a test email

To send a test notification using the AWS CLI, first get the from email address for the environment you want to test.

```bash
bin/terraform-init "infra/<APP_NAME>/service" "<ENVIRONMENT>"
FROM_EMAIL="$(terraform -chdir=infra/<APP_NAME>/service output -raw ses_from_email)"
```

Then run the following command, replacing `<RECIPIENT_EMAIL>` with the email address you want to send to:

```bash
aws sesv2 send-email \
  --from-email-address "$FROM_EMAIL" \
  --destination "ToAddresses=<RECIPIENT_EMAIL>" \
  --content '{
    "Simple": {
      "Subject": {
        "Data": "Test notification",
        "Charset": "UTF-8"
      },
      "Body": {
        "Text": {
          "Data": "This is a message from the future",
          "Charset": "UTF-8"
        },
        "Html": {
          "Data": "This is a message from the future",
          "Charset": "UTF-8"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

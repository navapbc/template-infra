# Database Access Control

## Manage `postgres` master user password with AWS Secrets Manager

The master user password is managed by Amazon RDS and Secrets Manager. Managing RDS master user passwords with Secrets Manager provides the following security benefits:

* RDS rotates database credentials regularly, without requiring application changes.
* Secrets Manager secures database credentials from human access and plain text view. The master password is not even in the terraform state file.

For more information about the benefits, see [Benefits of managing master user passwords with Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html#rds-secrets-manager-benefits).

## Database roles and permissions

The database roles are created by the master user `postgres` when the Role Manager lambda function runs. The following roles are created:

* **migrator** — The `migrator` role is the role the database migration task assumes. Database migrations are run as part of the deploy workflow before the new container image is deployed to the service. The `migrator` role has permissions to create tables in the `app` schema.
* **app** — The `app` role is the role the application service assumes. The `app` role has read/write permissions in the `app` schema.

## Database connections

The database authenticates connections with [IAM database authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html) (except when connecting as the `postgres` master user). The security benefits of this approach include:

* The system leverages IAM to centrally manage access to the database
* There are no long-lived user database credentials that need to be stored as database authentication tokens are generated by IAM and have a lifetime of 15 minutes

## Terraform code style

Follow [Hashicorp's Terraform style guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/style) when writing Terraform code, with a few exceptions (see below).

### Exceptions and additions to Hashicorp's Terraform style guide

Here are some exceptions (and additions) to Hashicorp's Terraform style guide.

#### Modules

- Use module names based on the logical function of the module rather than the underlying proprietary service used for implementing the module. For example, use "database" instead of "rds", or "storage" instead of "s3".
- Organize resources according to the infrastructure layers described in [module architecture](/docs/infra/module-architecture.md).
- [Use shared configuration](/docs/infra/module-dependencies.md) instead of the [tfe_outputs data source](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/data-sources/outputs) to share state between two state files.
- Use underscores instead of dashes in file names and module names.

#### File Names

- Separate words in filenames with underscores (\_) instead of dashes (-), e.g., main.tf, output_variables.tf.
- Use lowercase letters to avoid case sensitivity issues.

#### Variables

- Include additional type information in string variable names to clarify the value being stored. For example, use `access_policy_arn` instead of `access_policy`. Common examples of suffixes include: `_id`, `_arn`, and `_name`.
- Include units in numerical variable names. For example, use `max_request_seconds` instead of `max_request_time`.
- Use plural nouns for lists. For example, use `subnet_ids` to represent a list of subnet ids.
- Use `values_by_key` for maps that map keys to values. For example use `account_ids_by_name` to represent a map from account names to account ids.
- For boolean feature flags, use the prefix `enable_`, as in `enable_https`.

#### .gitignore

- Do not commit the `.terraform.lock.hcl` dependency lock file. As of Feb 2023, Terraform lock files, while well intentioned, have a tendency to get into a confusing state that requires recreating the lock file, which defeats the purpose. Moreover, lock files are per environment, which can make it difficult for people to upgrade dependencies (e.g. upgrade an AWS provider) across environments if certain environments are locked down (e.g. production).

#### Integration and unit testing

- For testing, use [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/docs/) instead of the [Terraform test framework](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/tests).

#### Policy

- For policy enforcement and compliance checks, [Tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec) is used instead of [Terraform's policy enforcement framework](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement)

## GitHub Actions style

- Use short job names with at most 3 words to improve readability within the GitHub UI. Long job names get cut off with an ellipsis (â€¦).
- Use imperative phrases for step names. Examples: "Build and publish", "Run migrations", "Set up Terraform".
- Use a single whitespace character for job names when calling reusable workflows. This is because in pull requests and in the workflow visualization, GitHub shows the job name as `<job name in calling workflow> / <job name in reusable workflow>` and the calling workflow job name is usually redundant. For example:

    ```yaml
    build-and-publish:
      name: " "
      uses: ./.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml
    ```

- Separate jobs with a blank line to improve scannability.
- Separate steps with a blank line to improve scannability. For example:

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    ```

- Separate job attributes that have nested attributes (i.e. object attributes) with a blank line to improve scannability except for the `with` clause when calling reusable workflows. For example:

    ```yaml
    e2e:
      name: E2E tests
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      strategy:
        matrix:
          shard: [1, 2, 3]

      steps:
    ```

    Exception: Do not include whitespace when calling reusable workflows. For example:

    ```yaml
    build-and-publish:
      name: " "
      uses: ./.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml
      with:
        app_name: app
    ```

## Shell script style

Follow [Google's Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html).

# Template repository for a Next.js application

This is a template repository for a Next.js-based application. While this template should be opinionated in some ways in order to reduce setup overhead where possible, it should be application-agnostic, meaning that any type of Next.js application should be able to be created from this template.

## Contents

This template includes setup for:

- `.github`: common GitHub configuration such as an empty PR template and a directory for GitHub workflows
- `app`: setup for the Next.js application should go here
- `docs`: a directory for project documentation
- `infra`: a directory for common infrastructure

## How to Run

### Without Docker

You can run the Next.js app without docker as follows:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn dev`
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application

You can run storybook without docker by running:

1. `yarn storybook`
2. Navigate to `localhost:6006` in your browser to view storybook

### With Docker

The Next.js application is dockerized. Take a look at `./app/Dockerfile` to see how it works.

A `docker-compose.yml` has been included to support local development and deployment. Take a look at `./docker-compose.yml` for more information.

1. In your terminal, `cd` to this repo.
2. Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed & running.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d --build` to build the image and start the container.
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application. Note that it takes a few minutes for the initial sass compiling to complete and load.
5. Run `docker-compose exec nextjs yarn storybook` to build and run storybook. Note that the initial sass compiling for storybook also takes a few minutes minutes to complete and load
5. Navigate to `localhost:6006` in your browser to view storybook.
6. Run `docker-compose down` when you are done to delete the container.

To support local development, the `docker-compose.yml` runs the `nextjs` container in development mode (i.e. `yarn dev`) instead of production mode (i.e. `yarn start`). This allows Next.js to do things like hot reload.

The docker-compose file bind mounts `app` on the host machine to `/srv` in the guest machine. However, to ensure that the container uses the correct packages in `node_modules`. This means that if you run `yarn add <package>` on the host machine in development (which will update `yarn.lock`), you'll also need to run `docker-compose exec nextjs yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to update `node_modules` in the guest machine.
